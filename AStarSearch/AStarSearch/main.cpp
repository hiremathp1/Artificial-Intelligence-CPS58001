/* This project is for students to practice search algorithms by appling them to solve the 9 puzzle problems.	 	  */
/*																												 	  */
/* Usage: The whole image is divided into 3-by-3 squares. There are 8 sub-images and 1 empty space.				 	  */
/*        These sub-images are placed in a random order, which makes the whole pattern look messy.               	  */
/*        So the goal is to re-organize these sub-images to align them in the right order.						 	  */
/*		  User can only move one sub-image at each time by left clicking it follwed by clicking the empty space. 	  */
/*		  Each time, only neighboring sub-images around the empty space can be moved. At any time, even in the   	  */
/*        begining, if you do not want to continue playing the game, you can simply hit the keyboard - "s" key to	  */
/*        obtain the solution. The system then automatically search for a possible path by using your implemented	  */
/*        search algorithmns. So after you click the "s" key, what you should do is just to wait for the search  	  */
/*        result and see the sub-images move automatically followed by the output path until all the sub-images  	  */
/*        become perfectly aligned.																				 	  */
